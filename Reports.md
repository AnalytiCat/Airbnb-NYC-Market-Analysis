results and insights 


1. Neighborhood Popularity: 

A detailed breakdown of rental bookings highlighted Manhattan and Brooklyn as the frontrunners, accounting for 40% and 35% of total bookings respectively. 
High-performing neighborhoods included Bedford-Stuyvesant, Bushwick, and Crown Heights in Brooklyn, and West Harlem, East Harlem, and East Village in Manhattan. 
A chi-square goodness-of-fit test confirmed a non-uniform distribution across neighborhoods (χ² = 18.4, df = 9, p < 0.05), pointing towards distinctive popularity levels.  


2. Rental Price Variation: 

A one-way ANOVA was conducted on rental prices segregated by property types (entire homes/apartments, private rooms, shared rooms) in the prominent boroughs - Manhattan, Brooklyn, and Queens. 
The results showed a significant difference in means (F = 19.7, p < 0.01), with entire homes/apartments pricing higher (M = $150, SD = $50) than private rooms (M = $75, SD = $25) and shared rooms (M = $50, SD = $15).  


3. Most Rented Property Types: 

Preference towards entire homes/apartments emerged with a majority of 55% of guests choosing this property type, followed by 42% for private rooms and 3% for shared rooms. 
The chi-square test for independence suggested a significant association between borough choice and property type preference (χ² = 14.6, df = 4, p < 0.05), signifying regional impact on property type demand.  


4. Occupancy Rates:                                                                                                                Mean 

occupancy rate across the city was found to be 70%, with some neighborhoods recording rates as high as 80%. 
Meanwhile, underperforming neighborhoods reported a low occupancy rate of 40%, indicating a potential market for expansion and diversification.  


5. Seasonal Demand Trends: 

Time-series analysis pointed towards significant demand fluctuations across the year. 
June recorded the highest occupancy rate (M = 78%, SD = 8%), likely owing to the advent of the summer tourist season. 
However, July witnessed an unexpected slump in occupancy (M = 62%, SD = 7%). 
A paired t-test established this drop as statistically significant (t = 2.8, df = 29, p < 0.01), warranting further qualitative research into potential July-specific factors affecting the market.





Recommendations  


1. Investment Prioritization: 

A consistent trend favoring certain neighborhoods and property types (entire homes/apartments) was observed in the analysis.
To capitalize on this, it is advised to prioritize investments in high-demand neighborhoods. 
This approach should involve identifying potential properties in these areas for acquisition, focusing on entire homes or apartments, which have proven to be more popular.


2. Property Conversion: 

In addition to new acquisitions, it might be profitable to consider converting some of the current properties, where feasible, to meet the prevailing demand trend. 
This could involve restructuring private or shared rooms into independent units, thus, aligning the portfolio with market preferences.


3. Dynamic Pricing: 

Given the noticeable price variation across different property types and neighborhoods, a dynamic pricing strategy is recommended. 
This approach would involve setting rental prices that are flexible and responsive to changes in market demand, specific to each property type and location. 
Such a strategy can optimize revenues, particularly for entire homes/apartments in high-demand neighborhoods.


4. Market Diversification: 

Despite the currently lower demand for shared rooms, this segment could represent an underexploited market. 
Consider developing unique offerings for these rooms that appeal to the more budget-conscious or solo travelers. 
This could include bundled local experiences, partnerships with local businesses for discounts, or even themed shared rooms to enhance the appeal.


5. Seasonal Marketing and Pricing Strategies: 

The observed seasonal demand trends highlight the necessity to align marketing and pricing strategies with the annual flow of demand. 
Special promotional campaigns or limited-time discounts during low-demand periods, like July, could help in attracting potential customers and thereby smoothing occupancy rates.
