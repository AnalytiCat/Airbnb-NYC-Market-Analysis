NYC Airbnb Data Analysis Project


Overview:

This repository contains the code and associated files for an in-depth data analysis project focused on Airbnb's listing data for New York City. The objective was to unravel crucial insights into the short-term rental market that could assist in strategic decision-making for businesses operating in this sphere, like Pillow Palooza.

Using a dataset publicly available on Airbnb's website, we investigated various aspects of the rental market, focusing on neighborhood popularity, rental price variation, preferred property types, occupancy rates, and seasonal demand trends.


Tools Utilized:

1. SQL: For data extraction, manipulation, and preliminary analysis.
2. Python: For in-depth data analysis, including the usage of various libraries such as pandas for data manipulation, matplotlib and seaborn for data visualization, and scipy and statsmodels for statistical analysis.


Research Questions

The analysis aimed to answer the following key research questions:

1. Neighborhood Popularity: Which neighborhoods in New York City are most favored by short-term renters?

2. Rental Price Variation: How does the rental price vary across different property types and neighborhoods?

3. Most Rented Property Types: What are the most rented property types in New York City, and does this preference differ across various neighborhoods?

4. Occupancy Rates: What are the occupancy rates across different neighborhoods, and how do these rates vary with property types?

5. Seasonal Demand Trends: How does the demand for short-term rentals fluctuate throughout the year, and are there any notable patterns or anomalies?


Key Findings and Recommendations:

This project revealed significant insights into the operations of the short-term rental market in NYC. Neighborhood preferences were identified, and it was discovered that rental prices significantly varied across different property types and neighborhoods. Additionally, a notable variation in occupancy rates across neighborhoods and property types was found, with certain underperforming areas identified as potential expansion opportunities.

Interestingly, the study also highlighted a significant peak in demand in June, followed by an unexpected drop in July, suggesting potential seasonal trends in the short-term rental market.

Based on these findings, several strategic recommendations were proposed, including investment prioritization, dynamic pricing, market diversification, and seasonal marketing and pricing strategies.
